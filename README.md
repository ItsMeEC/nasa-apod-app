## NASA APOD APP

NASA is a United States Agency responsible for scientific study related to air and outer space. NASA offers a lot of scientific information to the public online, some of that public information is used to run this application. It is a database in which a daily picture is posted every day relating to astronomical events and phenomena. In this application, a user enters a date via the arrows in the date selector in order to get one of NASA's daily pictures that was posted on that particular date. Please make sure to select a date in the past as NASA has not gone to the future, yet.
